Created a simple ScoreKeeper application using JavaScript for DOM manipulation. The application allows users to track scores for two players dynamically on a web page. It includes functionality to increment scores for each player, reset scores to zero, and select a custom game point limit. The project demonstrates proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to update and display score data in real-time.
